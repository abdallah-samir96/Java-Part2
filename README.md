a mechanism that encapsulates a group of classes, sub-packages, and interfaces.

## Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) 

<hr/>


Object-oriented programming (OOP) involves programming using objects.

An object represents an entity in the real world that can be distinctly identified.

**a student, a car, an account, a user and even a car can all be viewed as objects**

Each Object contains
- **properties or attributes or states**
- **functions or behavior or methods**

A **class** is a **template**, **blueprint**, or **contract** that defines what an objectâ€™s data fields and methods.
An **Object** is instance of this class.

### How to declare class 

```
class Car {

    // properties or attributes or data members or state
    // methods or functions or procedures
}
```


Properties could be primitive or reference types.<br/>
Method are the normal method.

to initialize the properties we can use **constructors**

### Constructor
<hr/>
 A constructor is a special method used to ** initialize objects ** when they are created.
